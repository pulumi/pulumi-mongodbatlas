/**
 * ## # Resource: mongodbatlas.Organization
 *
 * `mongodbatlas.Organization` provides programmatic management (including creation) of a MongoDB Atlas Organization resource.
 *
 * > **IMPORTANT NOTE:**  When you establish an Atlas organization using this resource, it automatically generates a set of initial public and private Programmatic API Keys. These key values are vital to store because you'll need to use them to grant access to the newly created Atlas organization. To use this resource, `roleNames` for new API Key must have the ORG_OWNER role specified.
 *
 * > **IMPORTANT NOTE:** To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Organization Owner role. The requesting API Key's organization must be a paying organization. To learn more, see Configure a Paying Organization in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.
 *
 * > **NOTE** Import command is currently not supported for this resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as mongodbatlas from "@pulumi/mongodbatlas";
 *
 * const test = new mongodbatlas.Organization("test", {
 *     orgOwnerId: "6205e5fffff79cde6f",
 *     name: "testCreateORG",
 *     description: "test API key from Org Creation Test",
 *     roleNames: ["ORG_OWNER"],
 * });
 * ```
