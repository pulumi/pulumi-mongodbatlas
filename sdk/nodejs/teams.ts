/**
 * `mongodbatlas.Teams` provides a Team resource. The resource lets you create, edit and delete Teams. Also, Teams can be assigned to multiple projects, and team members’ access to the project is determined by the team’s project role.
 *
 * > **IMPORTANT:** MongoDB Atlas Team limits: max 250 teams in an organization and max 100 teams per project.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find groupId in the official documentation.
 *
 * MongoDB Atlas Team limits: max 250 teams in an organization and max 100 teams per project.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as mongodbatlas from "@pulumi/mongodbatlas";
 *
 * const test = new mongodbatlas.Teams("test", {
 *     orgId: "<ORGANIZATION-ID>",
 *     usernames: [
 *         "user1@email.com",
 *         "user2@email.com",
 *         "user3@email.com",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Teams can be imported using the organization ID and team id, in the format ORGID-TEAMID, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import mongodbatlas:index/teams:Teams my_team 1112222b3bf99403840e8934-1112222b3bf99403840e8935
 * ```
 *
 *  See detailed information for arguments and attributes[MongoDB API Teams](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/teams-create-one/)
