/**
 * `mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow` provides a resource to schedule a maintenance window for your MongoDB Atlas Project and/or set to defer a scheduled maintenance up to two times.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.
 *
 * ## Maintenance Window Considerations:
 *
 * - Urgent Maintenance Activities Cannot Wait: Urgent maintenance activities such as security patches cannot wait for your chosen window. Atlas will start those maintenance activities when needed.
 *
 * Once maintenance is scheduled for your cluster, you cannot change your maintenance window until the current maintenance efforts have completed.
 * - Maintenance Requires Replica Set Elections: Atlas performs maintenance the same way as the manual maintenance procedure. This requires at least one replica set election during the maintenance window per replica set.
 * - Maintenance Starts As Close to the Hour As Possible: Maintenance always begins as close to the scheduled hour as possible, but in-progress cluster updates or expected system issues could delay the start time.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as mongodbatlas from "@pulumi/mongodbatlas";
 *
 * const test = new mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow("test", {
 *     dayOfWeek: 3,
 *     hourOfDay: 4,
 *     projectId: "<your-project-id>",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as mongodbatlas from "@pulumi/mongodbatlas";
 *
 * const test = new mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow("test", {
 *     defer: true,
 *     projectId: "<your-project-id>",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Maintenance Window entries can be imported using project project_id, in the format `PROJECTID`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import mongodbatlas:index/maintenanceWindow:MaintenanceWindow test 5d0f1f73cf09a29120e173cf
 * ```
 *
