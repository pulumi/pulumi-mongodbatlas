 * ## Import
 *
 * Private Endpoint Link Connection can be imported using project ID, private link ID, endpoint service ID, and provider name, in the format `{project_id}--{private_link_id}--{endpoint_service_id}--{provider_name}`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import mongodbatlas:index/privateLinkEndpointService:PrivateLinkEndpointService this 1112222b3bf99403840e8934--3242342343112--vpce-4242342343--AWS
 * ```
 * For more information, see:
 * - [MongoDB API Private Endpoint Link Connection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/operation/operation-creategroupprivateendpointendpointserviceendpoint) for detailed arguments and attributes.
 * - [Set Up a Private Endpoint](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-private-endpoint/) for general guidance on private endpoints in MongoDB Atlas.
