/**
 * `mongodbatlas.DatabaseUser` provides a Database User resource. This represents a database user which will be applied to all clusters within the project.
 *
 * Each user has a set of roles that provide access to the project’s databases. User's roles apply to all the clusters in the project: if two clusters have a `products` database and a user has a role granting `read` access on the products database, the user has that access on both clusters.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find groupId in the official documentation.
 *
 * > **WARNING:** The password argument is required for creation but should be removed after creation if it will be managed externally. More details can be found in the password argument documentation.
 *
 * > **IMPORTANT:** All arguments including the password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. Read more about sensitive data in state.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### S
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as mongodbatlas from "@pulumi/mongodbatlas";
 *
 * const test = new mongodbatlas.DatabaseUser("test", {
 *     username: "test-acc-username",
 *     password: "test-acc-password",
 *     projectId: "<PROJECT-ID>",
 *     authDatabaseName: "admin",
 *     roles: [
 *         {
 *             roleName: "readWrite",
 *             databaseName: "dbforApp",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             roleName: "readAnyDatabase",
 *             databaseName: "admin",
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     labels: [{
 *         key: "My Key",
 *         value: "My Value",
 *     }],
 *     scopes: [
 *         {
 *             name: "My cluster name",
 *             type: "CLUSTER",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             name: "My second cluster name",
 *             type: "CLUSTER",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as mongodbatlas from "@pulumi/mongodbatlas";
 *
 * const test = new mongodbatlas.DatabaseUser("test", {
 *     username: "test-acc-username",
 *     x509Type: "MANAGED",
 *     projectId: "<PROJECT-ID>",
 *     authDatabaseName: "$external",
 *     roles: [{
 *         roleName: "readAnyDatabase",
 *         databaseName: "admin",
 *     }],
 *     labels: [{
 *         key: "%s",
 *         value: "%s",
 *     }],
 *     scopes: [{
 *         name: "My cluster name",
 *         type: "CLUSTER",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as mongodbatlas from "@pulumi/mongodbatlas";
 *
 * const test = new mongodbatlas.DatabaseUser("test", {
 *     username: testAwsIamRole.arn,
 *     projectId: "<PROJECT-ID>",
 *     authDatabaseName: "$external",
 *     awsIamType: "ROLE",
 *     roles: [{
 *         roleName: "readAnyDatabase",
 *         databaseName: "admin",
 *     }],
 *     labels: [{
 *         key: "%s",
 *         value: "%s",
 *     }],
 *     scopes: [{
 *         name: "My cluster name",
 *         type: "CLUSTER",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example of how to create a OIDC federated authentication user
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as mongodbatlas from "@pulumi/mongodbatlas";
 *
 * const test = new mongodbatlas.DatabaseUser("test", {
 *     username: "64d613677e1ad50839cce4db/testUserOr",
 *     projectId: "6414908c207f4d22f4d8f232",
 *     authDatabaseName: "admin",
 *     oidcAuthType: "IDP_GROUP",
 *     roles: [{
 *         roleName: "readWriteAnyDatabase",
 *         databaseName: "admin",
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * `username` format: Atlas OIDC IdP ID (found in federation settings), followed by a '/', followed by the IdP group name
 *
 * Note: OIDC support is only avalible starting in [MongoDB 7.0](https://www.mongodb.com/evolved#mdbsevenzero) or later. To learn more, see the [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-oidc/).
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Database users can be imported using project ID and username, in the format `project_id`-`username`-`auth_database_name`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import mongodbatlas:index/databaseUser:DatabaseUser my_user 1112222b3bf99403840e8934-my_user-admin
 * ```
 * ~> __NOTE:__ Terraform will want to change the password after importing the user if a `password` argument is specified.
