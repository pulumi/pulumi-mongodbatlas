This parameter defaults to 1. If you specify a `NumShards` value of 1 and a `ClusterType` of SHARDED, Atlas deploys a single-shard [sharded cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster). Don't create a sharded cluster with a single shard for production environments. Single-shard sharded clusters don't provide the same benefits as multi-shard configurations.
        /// If you are upgrading a replica set to a sharded cluster, you cannot increase the number of shards in the same update request. You should wait until after the cluster has completed upgrading to sharded and you have reconnected all application clients to the MongoDB router before adding additional shards. Otherwise, your data might become inconsistent once MongoDB Cloud begins distributing data across shards.
