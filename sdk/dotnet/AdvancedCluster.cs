When set to true, the non-effective specs (`ElectableSpecs`, `ReadOnlySpecs`, `AnalyticsSpecs`) fields return the hardware specifications that the client provided. When set to false (default), the non-effective specs fields show the **current** hardware specifications. Cluster auto-scaling is the primary cause for differences between initial and current hardware specifications. This opt-in feature enhances auto-scaling workflows by eliminating the need for `lifecycle.ignore_changes` blocks and preventing plan drift from Atlas-managed changes. This attribute applies to dedicated clusters, not to tenant or flex clusters. This attribute will be deprecated in provider version 2.x and removed in 3.x when the new behavior becomes default. See Auto-Scaling with Effective Fields for more details.
        /// **Important:** Toggle this flag and remove any existing `lifecycle.ignore_changes` blocks for spec fields in the same apply, without combining other changes. Toggling will result in increased plan verbosity with `(known after apply)` markers, which can be safely ignored. If you previously removed `ReadOnlySpecs` or `AnalyticsSpecs` attributes from your configuration, you'll get a validation error for safety reasons to prevent accidental node loss. To resolve: add the blocks back (to keep nodes) or with `NodeCount = 0` (to delete nodes), apply without toggling the flag, then toggle in a separate apply.
