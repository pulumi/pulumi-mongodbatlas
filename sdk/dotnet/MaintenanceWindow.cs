    /// <summary>
    /// `mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow` provides a resource to schedule the maintenance window for your MongoDB Atlas Project and/or set to defer a scheduled maintenance up to two times. Please refer to [Maintenance Windows](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/cluster-maintenance-window/#configure-maintenance-window) documentation for more details.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** Only a single maintenance window resource can be defined per project.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** Maintenance window times use the project's configured timezone. To change the timezone, update the Project Time Zone setting in the Atlas Project Settings.
    /// 
    /// ## Maintenance Window Considerations:
    /// 
    /// - Urgent Maintenance Activities Cannot Wait: Urgent maintenance activities such as security patches cannot wait for your chosen window. Atlas will start those maintenance activities when needed.
    /// 
    /// Once maintenance is scheduled for your cluster, you cannot change your maintenance window until the current maintenance efforts have completed.
    /// - Maintenance Requires Replica Set Elections: Atlas performs maintenance the same way as the manual maintenance procedure. This requires at least one replica set election during the maintenance window per replica set.
    /// - Maintenance Starts As Close to the Hour As Possible: Maintenance always begins as close to the scheduled hour as possible, but in-progress cluster updates or expected system issues could delay the start time.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Mongodbatlas = Pulumi.Mongodbatlas;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var test = new Mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow("test", new()
    ///     {
    ///         ProjectId = "&lt;your-project-id&gt;",
    ///         DayOfWeek = 3,
    ///         HourOfDay = 4,
    ///         ProtectedHours = new Mongodbatlas.Inputs.MaintenanceWindowProtectedHoursArgs
    ///         {
    ///             StartHourOfDay = 9,
    ///             EndHourOfDay = 17,
    ///         },
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Mongodbatlas = Pulumi.Mongodbatlas;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var test = new Mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow("test", new()
    ///     {
    ///         ProjectId = "&lt;your-project-id&gt;",
    ///         Defer = true,
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ### Further Examples
    /// - Configure Maintenance Window
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Maintenance Window entries can be imported using project project_id, in the format `PROJECTID`, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import mongodbatlas:index/maintenanceWindow:MaintenanceWindow test 5d0f1f73cf09a29120e173cf
