{
    /// <summary>
    /// `mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow` provides a resource to schedule a maintenance window for your MongoDB Atlas Project and/or set to defer a scheduled maintenance up to two times.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.
    /// 
    /// ## Maintenance Window Considerations:
    /// 
    /// - Urgent Maintenance Activities Cannot Wait: Urgent maintenance activities such as security patches cannot wait for your chosen window. Atlas will start those maintenance activities when needed.
    /// 
    /// Once maintenance is scheduled for your cluster, you cannot change your maintenance window until the current maintenance efforts have completed.
    /// - Maintenance Requires Replica Set Elections: Atlas performs maintenance the same way as the manual maintenance procedure. This requires at least one replica set election during the maintenance window per replica set.
    /// - Maintenance Starts As Close to the Hour As Possible: Maintenance always begins as close to the scheduled hour as possible, but in-progress cluster updates or expected system issues could delay the start time.
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Mongodbatlas = Pulumi.Mongodbatlas;
    /// 
    /// class MyStack : Stack
    /// {
    ///     public MyStack()
    ///     {
    ///         var test = new Mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow("test", new Mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindowArgs
    ///         {
    ///             DayOfWeek = 3,
    ///             HourOfDay = 4,
    ///             ProjectId = "&lt;your-project-id&gt;",
    ///         });
    ///     }
    /// 
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Mongodbatlas = Pulumi.Mongodbatlas;
    /// 
    /// class MyStack : Stack
    /// {
    ///     public MyStack()
    ///     {
    ///         var test = new Mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow("test", new Mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindowArgs
    ///         {
    ///             Defer = true,
    ///             ProjectId = "&lt;your-project-id&gt;",
    ///         });
    ///     }
    /// 
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Maintenance Window entries can be imported using project project_id, in the format `PROJECTID`, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import mongodbatlas:index/maintenanceWindow:MaintenanceWindow test 5d0f1f73cf09a29120e173cf
    /// ```
