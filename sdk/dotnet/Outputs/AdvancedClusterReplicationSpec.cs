This parameter defaults to 1. If you specify a `num_shards` value of 1 and a `cluster_type` of SHARDED, Atlas deploys a single-shard [sharded cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster). Don't create a sharded cluster with a single shard for production environments. Single-shard sharded clusters don't provide the same benefits as multi-shard configurations.
