/**
 * `mongodbatlas.Organization` provides programmatic management (including creation) of a MongoDB Atlas Organization resource.
 * 
 * &gt; **IMPORTANT NOTE:**  When you establish an Atlas organization using this resource, it automatically generates a set of initial credentials. Defining `description` and `roleNames` creates a Programmatic API Key (public and private key) — in this case, `roleNames` must have the ORG_OWNER role specified. Defining a `serviceAccount` block creates a Service Account (client ID and client secret) instead. The API does not allow creating both in the same request. These credential values are stored in the Terraform state and used by the resource for subsequent operations on the organization.
 * 
 * &gt; **IMPORTANT NOTE:** To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Organization Owner role. The requesting API Key&#39;s organization must be a paying organization. To learn more, see Configure a Paying Organization in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * ### With Programmatic API Key
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * package generated_program;
 * 
 * import com.pulumi.Context;
 * import com.pulumi.Pulumi;
 * import com.pulumi.core.Output;
 * import com.pulumi.mongodbatlas.Organization;
 * import com.pulumi.mongodbatlas.OrganizationArgs;
 * import java.util.List;
 * import java.util.ArrayList;
 * import java.util.Map;
 * import java.io.File;
 * import java.nio.file.Files;
 * import java.nio.file.Paths;
 * 
 * public class App {
 *     public static void main(String[] args) {
 *         Pulumi.run(App::stack);
 *     }
 * 
 *     public static void stack(Context ctx) {
 *         var this_ = new Organization("this", OrganizationArgs.builder()
 *             .orgOwnerId("<ORG_OWNER_ID>")
 *             .name("testCreateORG")
 *             .description("test API key from Org Creation")
 *             .roleNames("ORG_OWNER")
 *             .build());
 * 
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * ## Import
 * 
 * You can import an existing organization using the organization ID, e.g.:
 * 
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import mongodbatlas:index/organization:Organization this 5d09d6a59ccf6445652a444a
 * ```
 * 
 * &gt; **IMPORTANT:** When importing an existing organization, you should **NOT** specify the creation-only attributes (`orgOwnerId`, `description`, `roleNames`, `federationSettingsId`, `serviceAccount`) in your Terraform configuration.
 * 
 * See the Guide: Importing MongoDB Atlas Organizations for more information.
 * 
 * For more information about the `mongodbatlas.Organization` resource see: [MongoDB Atlas Admin API Organization](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/api/doc/atlas-admin-api-v2/group/endpoint-organizations).
