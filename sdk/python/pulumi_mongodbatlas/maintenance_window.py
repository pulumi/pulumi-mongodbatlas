        `MaintenanceWindow` provides a resource to schedule a maintenance window for your MongoDB Atlas Project and/or set to defer a scheduled maintenance up to two times.

        > **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find `groupId` in the official documentation.

        ## Maintenance Window Considerations:

        - Urgent Maintenance Activities Cannot Wait: Urgent maintenance activities such as security patches cannot wait for your chosen window. Atlas will start those maintenance activities when needed.

        Once maintenance is scheduled for your cluster, you cannot change your maintenance window until the current maintenance efforts have completed.
        - Maintenance Requires Replica Set Elections: Atlas performs maintenance the same way as the manual maintenance procedure. This requires at least one replica set election during the maintenance window per replica set.
        - Maintenance Starts As Close to the Hour As Possible: Maintenance always begins as close to the scheduled hour as possible, but in-progress cluster updates or expected system issues could delay the start time.

        ## Example Usage

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_mongodbatlas as mongodbatlas

        test = mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow("test",
            day_of_week=3,
            hour_of_day=4,
            project_id="<your-project-id>")
        ```

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_mongodbatlas as mongodbatlas

        test = mongodbatlas.MaintenanceWindow("test",
            defer=True,
            project_id="<your-project-id>")
        ```

        ## Import

        Maintenance Window entries can be imported using project project_id, in the format `PROJECTID`, e.g.

        ```sh
         $ pulumi import mongodbatlas:index/maintenanceWindow:MaintenanceWindow test 5d0f1f73cf09a29120e173cf
        ```
