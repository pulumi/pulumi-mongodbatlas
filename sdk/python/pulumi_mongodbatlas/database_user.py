        `.DatabaseUser` provides a Database User resource. This represents a database user which will be applied to all clusters within the project.

        Each user has a set of roles that provide access to the project’s databases. User's roles apply to all the clusters in the project: if two clusters have a `products` database and a user has a role granting `read` access on the products database, the user has that access on both clusters.

        > **NOTE:** Groups and projects are synonymous terms. You may find group_id in the official documentation.

        > **IMPORTANT:** All arguments including the password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
